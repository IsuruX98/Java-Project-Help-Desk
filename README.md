In the Jakarta Servlet project, my focus was on user management and UI design using UI Kit CSS. I implemented features such as user registration, login, password reset, profile viewing, updating, and account deletion. Additionally, I utilized UI Kit CSS to create an attractive and user-friendly interface. The project aimed to enhance my understanding of Java web development and gain practical experience in building functional and visually appealing web applications.
